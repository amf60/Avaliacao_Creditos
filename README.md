# Avaliacao_Creditos

Extra Module 6 â€“ Data Sciences Applied to finances.

Contrary to first 5 modules of this Alura Bootcamp Applied Data Sciences II (ABADSII), that were related to Covid-19 related matters, 
this extra module focused on data science applied to the financial market.
More precisely the developpment of a machine learning model based on Vintage Analysis Modeling Technique. 
This model will then be run in an end-user web-based interface Credit Evaluator Simulator for our fictional bytebank. 

In this module, we were guided by the Alura team throughout the complete life cycle of this Data Sciences project.

Overall, this project was developped in 3 phases using a large variety of tools:

* Phase I - We covered from the basic, dataset import, wrangling, ETA, created functions, explored, 
and identified the best model for a credit evaluator simulator. All the work done on this phase used only one Google Colab notebook.

* Phase II - We transfered to our hard drive the three key objets - fields' list, features and model, that closed the the phase I notebook.
The design of these 3 objects was carefully thought to respond the tecnical needs of the the tools to be used in the phase 3 of our project 

* Phase III - We then became acquainted with the combined use of triad of tools - Github desktop, Visual Study Code and Streamlit - 
to create and test a web-based interface to our credit evaluator simulator for our fictional bytebank.
